# Mood Keeper
Small exercise to learn web dev. Every day, users are asked to fill a 3-answer questionnaire about (1) how they are feeling, (2) how much they've slept, and (3) how much they've exercised. The user is then shown charts displaying their answers over the past week, the goal of which is to help the user track the progress of his or her mood as well as potentially mood-affecting life habits over time.
